# Architectural Decision Log Tool

This log lists the architectural decisions for this project.

For new ADRs, please use *docs/templates/adr.template.adoc* as basis. You can easily create a new ADR with *adr* command based on the template:

```sh
./adr new My New ADR
```

For generating a new _README.adoc_ and _index.html_ use the _compile_ task:

```sh
./adr compile
```

Requires https://nodejs.org/en/[NodeJS] and https://asciidoctor.org/[ASCIIDoc] installed.
